	<h2>Sorry, it seems like you're not on the bus yet.</h2>
	<h3>While it's so great that you're excited to share your feelings, we ask that you wait until you've boarded!</h3>

	<p class="small">This project is an iteration of a geographic emotional tracker that aims to map the sentiments of passengers along various bus, train, and plane routes across the United States and the world. It was created by <a class="infolink" href="http://rouxpz.com">Roopa Vasudevan</a>.</p>
	<p class="small">A companion map-based visualization of collected sentiments will soon be accessible from this site, and will be exhibited as part of <a class="infolink" href="">Fung Wah Biennial</a>, a 2016 Major Exhibition at <a class="infolink" href="http://fluxfactory.org">Flux Factory</a>.
